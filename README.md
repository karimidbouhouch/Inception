# Inception
The purpose of this project is to broaden your knowledge of system administration by using Docker. To complete this project, you need to set up a small infrastructure composed of different services under specific rules, all in a virtual machine using Docker Compose. You will also need to create Docker images for each service and ensure that they have the same name as their corresponding service. Additionally, you will need to create a Makefile that sets up your entire application and builds the Docker images using docker-compose.yml
